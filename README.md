## This Project

After learning Laravel the other day, I wanted to give it my own attempt using what I'd learned. This is an app that allows users to track the books they are reading, including the number of pages they've read and the number of pages in the book.

This is the draft of a project, and was created all within the day of 4/21/2025. 
There are plenty of bugs or simple issues - for instance, a user could enter a number of pages larger than the number of pages in the book itself. In that case, it turns red to indicate that the book hasn't been started yet.
There's also a design bug I'm aware of - when testing on a mobile device, there's a few places with text that is cut off and unreadable.

As mentioned above, this is the draft of a project. I may continue the project and resolve these issues later, but for now this serves as a notice for what's been done, and a warning for what's missing.


## Images

This code cannot be run without a few of the key components including the database. Images here display how the code performs on my devices.

Pictures will be added here tomorrow.
